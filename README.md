4. After that, find the miFile files on your computer that you want to add to TradeOnSda (you can select many accounts at once)
5. After adding MaFile - you need to `enter the password` from the added steam account and click `Try login`. You will also be able to specify the HTTP Proxy, through which this account will work (this is not required, you can not specify a proxy)
   You can also immediately enable auto-confirmation of exchanges for the added account (if necessary, you can turn off). The program itself will check every 60 seconds for unconfirmed exchanges or expositions to the trading floor steam, and if something needs to be confirmed - it will automatically confirm.

## Roadmap for developing and adding new features.

Here you will see our upcoming upgrade plans.
>We have a lot of work on the basic tools of TradeOnBots for autotrading in steam, so we cannot say exactly when new features will be introduced for TradeOnSda (we are doing this free development in our spare time)

1. Mac and Linux versions.
2. Check if the password is correct and notify if it is incorrect (when adding an account, and when re-login)
3. Adding a proxy status indicator.
4. Adding additional checkbox, which allows to enable auto-confirmation of outgoing trades.
5. Adding an additional checkbox that allows you to automatically accept incoming trades in which you give nothing (auto-accept gifts)
6. Adding a detailed window in the exchanges confirmation, which will show all the items involved in the exchange.
7. Ability to add a guard to empty accounts that do not have a guard.

## Additional useful information

1. Be sure to resurrect your `maFile` from the accounts. If you lose your `maFile`, you may lose access to your accounts.
2. If your computer will be infected with a virus - `fraudsters can steal your maFile`, be careful and do not download applications from unverified sources from the Internet.
3. If you lost your `maFiles` OR lost your encryption key, go [here](https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage) and click `Remove Authenticator` then enter your revocation code that you wrote down when you first added your account to SDA.
4. If you did not follow the directions and did not write your revocation code down, you're well and truly screwed. The only option is beg to [Steam Support](https://support.steampowered.com/) and say you lost your mobile authenticator and the revocation code.

## Possible problems and solutions

This branch will continue to grow, depending on users' questions.
